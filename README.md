This is a simple code to see the effect of different fitlers on music.
The idea was to use a filter to eliminate white noise or such sorts while recording guitar riffs in real life. 
I used MATLAB's handel to check the effect of my filters.

First step was to see the dominant frequencies of the sample file. 
Based on that choose different frequencies in the higher/lower ranges to pass to specific functions low pass/ high pass/ band pass to get its desired output.
