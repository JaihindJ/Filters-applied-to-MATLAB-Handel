This is a simple code to see the effect of different fitlers on music.
The idea was to use a filter to eliminate white noise or such sorts while recording guitar riffs in real life. 
I used MATLAB's handel to check the effect of my filters.
First step was to see the dominant frequencies of the sample file. 
Based on thatchoose different frequencies in the higher/lower ranges to pass to specific functions based on the need.
